## Physics of Semiconductors
The functionality of any electronic device largely relies on the physics and properties of the semiconductors that are used in that device. Hence the basic
physics of semiconductors in different phases have been the subject of vast majority of researches in the electronic device field. Here some of the most important device-related aspect of semiconductors are reviewed.
