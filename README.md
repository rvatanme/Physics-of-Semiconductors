# Physics of Semiconductors
The functionality of an electronic device largely relies on the physics and properties of the semiconductors that are used in that device. Hence the basic
physics of semiconductors in different phases have been the subject of vast majority of studies in the electronic device field. Here, some most important device-related aspects of semiconductors are reviewed as follows:


    Carrier Concentration at Thermal Equilibrium
    Carrier Transport Phenomena
    Phonon, Optical, and Thermal Properties
    Heterojunctions and Nanostructures
    Basic Equations

## Carrier Concentration in Bulk Semiconductors
The concentration of carriers (holes and electrons) in a bulk semiconductor at thermal equilibrium is govern by the Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics. FD statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a system consisting of many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. As a result of FD statistics the FD distribution describe the distribution of particles over energy states. FD statistics applies to identical and indistinguishable particles with half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, etc.), called fermions, in thermodynamic equilibrium. For the case of negligible interaction between particles, the system can be described in terms of single-particle energy states. A result is the FD distribution of particles over these states where no two particles can occupy the same state, which has a considerable effect on the properties of the system. FD statistics is most commonly applied to electrons, a type of fermion with spin 1/2. Without FD statistics, explaning several aspects of electron behavior is immposible, including heat capacity and current emission.  

In a system of non interacting electrons, in thermodynamic equilibrium, FD distribution function gives the probability of occupying a single electronic state by an electron as a function of the energy of that state (E) and the temperature (T) of the system.
