# Physics of Semiconductors
The functionality of an electronic device largely relies on the physics and properties of the semiconductors that are used in that device. Hence the basic
physics of semiconductors in different phases have been the subject of vast majority of studies in the electronic device field. Here some of these most important device-related aspect of semiconductors are reviewed.

## Carrier Concentration in Bulk Semiconductors
The concentration of free carriers (holes and electrons) in valence and conduction bands of a semiconductor is govern by the Fermi-Dirac statistics. Fermi-Dirac statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a system consisting of many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. A result is the Fermiâ€“Dirac distribution of particles over energy states.
